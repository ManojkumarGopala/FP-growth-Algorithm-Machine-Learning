Machine Learning Algorithms
Data mining is used to deal with the huge size of the data stored in the database to extract the
desired information and knowledge. It has various techniques for the extraction of data; association
rule mining is the most effective data mining technique among them. It discovers hidden or desired
pattern from large amount of data. Among the existing techniques the frequent pattern growth (FP
growth) algorithm is the most efficient algorithm in finding out the desired association rules. It scans
the database only twice for the processing. In this project the FP growth 
algorithm has been implemented and have evaluated the model on four datasets from UCI machine learning repository
